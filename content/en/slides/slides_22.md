The following provides links to slide shows covering topics that where not included in
this year's offering of GEN242. These topics were excluded because
they operlapped with similar material covered by other courses students in the class 
had already taken, a strong interest in learning more about advanced data 
analysis programming techniques (_e.g._ modern R graphics, _dplyr/tidyr_, package development and Shiny Apps), 
as well as time limitations.
